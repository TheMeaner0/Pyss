# Pyss - Python Password Manager

**Pyss** is a simple yet secure password manager built with Python. This project for me to learn programming, I have plans to improve it with a graphical interface using Tkinter.

## Features
- Securely store and retrieve passwords
- Copy passwords to clipboard using `pyperclip` (no need to expose passwords)
- Encryption implemented with the `cryptography` library

## Goals
- **Python Mastery**: Improve my programming with this project.
- **GUI**: Currently this project is a command-line program in the future I will add a GUI with tkinter.
- **Improve Security**: As the name as "Improve Secruity".
- **Improve Usability**: Make Pyss more user-friendly.

## Dependencies
- `cryptography` (for encryption)
- `pyperclip` (for clipboard management)

Feel free to contribute or share any tips that could help me on this learning journey!

Psst, this project might have "bad" code. Forgive me if it does, make a commit to help me with programming. :)
